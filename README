Experimental code for Machine Learning project
==============================================

This package is a skeleton of a framework for computing the
sparse dictionary coding classification problem for face
recognition. This framework is described in detail in 

J. Wright, A. Y. Yang, A. Ganesh, S. S. Sastry, and Y. Ma, 
Robust face recognition via sparse representation.

vol. 31, no. 2, pp. 210-27, Feb. 2009. 


Datasets
--------

Face databases are required to use the code herein. Paths to
databases, and other configuration parameters should be defined in the
following file:

I've only implemented import methods for the Extended Yale B dataset,
as described in 

A. S. Georghiades, P. N. Belhumeur, and D. J. Kriegman, 
From Few to Many : Illumination Cone Models for Face Recognition under 
Variable Lighting and Pose,
